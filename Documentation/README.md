# Rook

**The Rook NFS operator is [deprecated](https://github.com/rook/nfs#deprecated)**

Rook is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator**, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.

Rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Rook uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.

Rook integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.

For more details about the status of storage solutions currently supported by Rook, please refer to the [project status section](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/README.md#project-status) of the Rook repository.
We plan to continue adding support for other storage systems and environments based on community demand and engagement in future releases.

## Quick Start Guides

Starting Rook in your cluster is as simple as a few `kubectl` commands depending on the storage provider.
See our [Quickstart](quickstart.md) guide list for the detailed instructions to install the NFS operator.

# Deprecated
The Rook NFS operator has been deprecated due to lack of community support. We recommend that users
consider [Rook-Ceph's CephNFS](https://rook.github.io/docs/rook/latest/ceph-nfs-crd.html) which is
under active development. Alternatively, there is a
[classical, non-CSI NFS server provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-ganesha-server-and-external-provisioner)
if users don't wish to run a CephCluster and CephFilesystem to host NFS storage.

## What is Rook?

Rook is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator** for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.

Rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Rook uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.

Rook integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.

For more details about the storage solutions currently supported by Rook, please refer to the [project status section](#project-status) below.
We plan to continue adding support for other storage systems and environments based on community demand and engagement in future releases. See our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for more details.

Rook is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a [graduated](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/) level project. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's involved and how Rook plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/01/29/cncf-host-rook-project-cloud-native-storage-capabilities).
